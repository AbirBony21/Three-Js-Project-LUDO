# Three-JS Ludo Game Project  

This repository contains the final report and implementation of a 3D Ludo game created using the Three.js framework. The project showcases various interactive and visually dynamic features, fulfilling specific requirements set forth in the Computer Graphics Lab (CSE 4204) course.

---

## Project Overview  

The Three-JS Ludo Game Project was developed to simulate a visually engaging 3D Ludo board environment with features such as custom textures, animations, and interactive user controls. The project emphasizes creative utilization of Three.js, including shaders, lighting, camera manipulation, and event handling.

## Features  

1. **Ludo Board [with Texture]**  
   - A three-dimensional Ludo board rendered using `BoxGeometry`.  
   - Four textures are integrated, with color variations applied to the boardâ€™s sides for added realism.  
   - The board is positioned and rotated for an optimal viewer perspective.  

2. **Ludo Dice [with Texture]**  
   - A 3D dice object created using `BoxGeometry` with unique textures for all six faces.  
   - Positioned on the Ludo board.  

3. **Dynamic Texture Changes**  
   - A mouse click event cycles through the available textures on the Ludo board.  
   - After reaching the last texture, the board resets to the default texture.  

4. **Camera Movement**  
   - Implemented using keyboard interactions.  
   - The camera moves horizontally using the left and right arrow keys while maintaining focus on the target object.  

5. **Dice Animation**  
   - The dice rotates along a horizontal axis for added realism and dynamism.  

6. **Additional Features**  
   - A surrounding room was created with textured walls and a floor.  
   - These enhancements provide a more immersive environment.

## Project Requirements  

The following requirements were successfully met in this project:  
- Implementation of **custom shaders** for enhanced visual effects.  
- Dynamic **lighting** for individual objects.  
- A **perspective projection** camera to improve 3D visualization.  
- Addition of **mouse and keyboard interactions** to enhance interactivity.  
- Integration of **animations**, such as the rotation of the dice.

## Tools and Technologies  

1. **Three.js**  
   - Framework used to develop the 3D Ludo game.  

2. **Software Platform**  
   - **VS Code**: Development environment.  
   - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment.
